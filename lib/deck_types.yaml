# https://mtg.wiki/page/Core_Set_2021/Arena_Starter_Kit
# There are two versions of the Starter Kits (the Demo Decks used in-store as part of the new player experience kit,
# and a version sold through Amazon).
# The differences are that the Amazon-version includes a code for the decks in of MTG Arena, while the in-store version does not,
# also the Amazon-version includes a second Ironscale Hydra and Demon of Loathing (both regular and foil)
# in lieu of Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose and Kogla, the Titan Ape. In addition, the in-store Arena Starter Kit Demo Decks
# may vary globally — some regions receive different decks.
#
# So it's not really a sideboard, but I don't see better category for it.
# I guess we could list 2 separate versions of these decks?

# Five monocolored decks are unlocked after the tutorial and can be upgraded by completing the new player Color Challenges.
# Cards that are replaced through these upgrades are automatically moved to the sideboard.

# So it's not really a sideboard, but I don't see better category for it.
